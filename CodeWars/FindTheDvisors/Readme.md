#Find the divisors!

Create a function named divisors/Divisors that takes an integer and returns an array with all of the integer's divisors(except for 1 and the number itself). If the number is prime return the string '(integer) is prime' (null in C#) (use Either String a in Haskell and Result<Vec<u32>, String> in Rust)

You can assume the input to the function will always be positive
